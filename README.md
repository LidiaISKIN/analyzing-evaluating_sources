The data set DF_may.csv, DF_june.csv contain the following fields:
1) source (source id);
2) message (message id);
3) id_ath (author’s id);
4) date (date of the message);
5) type (message type);
6) like (the number of “likes” to the message);
7) comm (the number of comments on the message);
8) repost (the number of “repost” messages);
9) view (the number of views of the message).


the datasets were anonymized: the sources and messages were assigned IDs in a random order, while preserving the number of messages from the source and quantitative charac-teristics from the source’s audience.

Data source social network vk.com (Russian).
